1. get your commit id from your local ide or from history
3. get your repository url 
2. append the id to this url at the end  https://github.com/<userid>/<repository-name>/commit/<commitid>

**for eg.** if my commit id is this "4ea1d4020a6e822a5e1828d4e3e95a9b86ff64f4" <br>
        and my repository is this "https://github.com/mdparthi/SpringBootSecurity" <br>
		then I can find the commit like this  https://github.com/mdparthi/SpringBootSecurity/commit/4ea1d4020a6e822a5e1828d4e3e95a9b86ff64f4
